import javax.swing.JViewport;

/**
 * An extension of <code>javax.swing.JViewport</code>
 * that allows pluggable custom painting of its background
 * and foreground. Since the painting is done on the
 * viewport itself, it will not scroll when the view is
 * scrolled. The resulting effect is that the view seems
 * to float in space between the fixed background and
 * foreground.
 * <p> 
 * It is important to remember to set the opacity of
 * the component that this viewport displays to false,
 * so that the viewport's background can show through.
 * <p>
 * Example of use with a JEditorPane:
 *
 * <pre>
 * JEditorPane ep = new JEditorPane();
 *
 * // important so that we can see through the JEditorPane
 * ep.setOpaque(false);
 *
 * JScrollPane sp = new JScrollPane();
 * WatermarkViewport vp = new WatermarkViewport(bgPainter, fgPainter);
 * vp.setView(ep);
 * sp.setViewport(vp);
 * </pre>
